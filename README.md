### Front-End: 6. Coming Soon

Learning GitHub project management and Responsive templates. I've employed labels, milestones and assigning merges to specific tasks to simulate proper project documentation and test out those tools. In addition I've made three css animations of different  speeds to showcase how css can imitate actual Javascript funtionality, although with great difficulty. Same can be said about css being superseded by SVG but I didn't use it in this project yet.
